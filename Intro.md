## DevNet 2556 - Python on IOS-XE

### Introduction
This lab serves as introduction to using the on-box Python container available in IOS-XE.  This container has been added to IOS-XE versions 16.5 and later.  

Throughout the lab we will explore using the Python container running on the Guest Shell service.  We will also walk through executing Python scripts from CLI.  

Python's usage in configuring network devices can be shown through a couple of major capabilities which we will explore during this lab:  NETCONF/YANG integration and the Python API to allow CLI configuration directly from a Python script.
